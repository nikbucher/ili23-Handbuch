=== Formats for data exchange

At some point all data have to be memorized in a specific format so that they can be stored and exchanged between software packages. More recent transfer formats are all based upon the _Extensible Markup Language_ (XML), a widespread format because of its extremely simple structure, its affinity with HTML (the format of web sites) and its derivation from SGML (a formerly frequently used format).

For instance the _Geographic Markup Language_ (GML) is a strictly defined XML dialect propagated by OpenGIS, a manufacturer consortium of GIS-Software. INTERLIS, on the contrary, does not prescribe any specific XML dialect but supplies rules that allow the automatic derivation of an exchange format from the respective data model.

All things considered the question of the data format is secondary: As long as data to be transmitted are based upon similar models their conversion from one format into another requires little effort.
