=== Inheritance on a larger scale

Not always the distinction between sub- and super class is justified on a mere factual basis. Organizational considerations may be decisive.

For instance in Ilis Valley they basically agree with the idea of an alpine transport as conceived by the National Tourist Office. Nevertheless they are not quite satisfied:

* For those lines that run up to Mount Ilis it would be interesting to know the course of the tracks. If it were to be captured, then the course could be added to the maps that are available free for tourists at the information centre.
* Furthermore Ilis Valley would like to record, which lines are suitable for hikers and toboggans.

Both are properties that basically apply to every alpine transport could feature – they simply do not feature in the national model. Of course Ilis Valley has asked the National Tourist Office to adjust their model accordingly. But the only reply they got as that they neither had the time nor the money to alter all their computer systems in the country just to gratify the wishes of some mountain valley. So what now?

Some reckoned that the National Tourist Office had best be ignored since it consisted mainly of bureaucrats without the least understanding for practical matters! (Other words were mentioned that had nothing whatsoever to do with the matter.)

Others could relate to the opinion of the National Tourist Office – just imagine if every valley were to have their own way. And besides they still profited from the National Tourist Office: with the data they are sent material for and about the Ilis Valley is produced.

So should the people in charge renounce their extra wishes? Or double gather all their data – once for themselves, once for the National Tourist Office?

.The National Tourist Office is not willing to adjust their model to the extra wishes of Ilis Valley. Thanks to inheritance Ilis Valley can still collect their data: Their topic AlpineTransports inherits everything from the national topic AlpineTransports, but adds as an extension the object class MITAlpineTransport with additional properties.

Thanks to inheritance this conflict could be solved. In Ilis Valley all railways are captured as MITAlpineTransport with all extensions. Since MITAlpineTransport is a sub class of AlpineTransport (in accordance with the National Tourist Office), each MITAlpineTransport can be read as an ordinary AlpineTransport. Hence Ilis Valley can send their data just as they are to the National Tourist Office.

[NOTE]
====
Inheritance can also be used to support federal characteristics.

_To be exact it is due to polymorphism that is rendered possible by inheritance: Each entity of a sub class can be regarded as part of the super class (cf. paragraph <<_5_5>>). Thus the National Tourist Office can process data from each alpine transport in the country even if it is an example of a local sub class of «alpine transport» unknown to the National Tourist Office._

Inheritance does not go very far with INTERLIS: Not only classes and topics, but also domains (types), views, graphic definitions, in a certain sense even units can be inherited and specified.
