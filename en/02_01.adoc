=== Awakening in Ilis Valley

[#_2_1_1]
==== The starting shot

The tourist region of Ilis Valley has decided to update their WebPages. The various possibilities of public transportation should be interactively read back by means of a graphic dialog. Its presentation in the town hall was impressive: Beautiful pictures, trendy abbreviations such as HTML, XML, GIS, SVG! Of course other requests arose almost immediately. Not very long ago it had been decided in the department of construction to list addresses according to a new norm. This ought to be put to advantage! The managing director of the Mount Ilis Alpine Transports remembered that the national association of alpine transports intended to establish a service, which would render available the alpine transport on offer in the entire country. It should also state fares and above all the different season tickets available for the area. His colleague, responsible for technical matters draws their attention to the fact that he supervises the entire infrastructure on his computer. No trouble to procure information concerning railway tracks and ski runs. Although there are some minor problems. Recently he had asked for data regarding the new development «Upper Crescent». In the end they had succeeded somehow, even though some pieces of information had been lost. However they were not that important.

That made the president of the township prick up her ears. A colleague working in a town, closer to the capital has told her that in one department they have already changed software for the third time. Additional demands that she would have deemed normal had caused a complete overhaul at every time. Then they had been supported by an information technologist who had not so much talked about different techniques but together they had thought about what data actually caused these problems. Since this new procedure was in use they gradually achieved better results.

Thus the president of the township, a friendly yet resolute woman, charges the building secretary to attend to this matter together with the technical manager of the Mount Ilis Alpine Transport. As her counselor she calls in the information technologist of her colleague.

==== First appraisal

During the first meeting of the work group different arguments and key words tumbled to and for. What software package was used by the national association? Do we only speak of the railway company or each individual railway, each ski lift? The individual railways as well as their buildings already appear in national surveying. How can these data be put to use? What happens if data change or if new data are added? But my software package only understands DXF! And me nothing at all!

At this point it was agreed to call a halt. Remembering the old Roman saying «Divide et impera» they tried to master the situation by first establishing some order. To start with, the following questions were in the foreground:

* Who needs what data?
* Who is in charge of their recording and update?

.Parties concerned and flow of information.

But how are these data transferred from processor to user? E-mail, FTP, DXF, ASCII – and discussion started again. The information technologist recommended to put this question aside for the time being and to consider the modeling of these data instead. Modeling? What on earth had modeling to do with an IT-solution for Ilis Valley? The question what a data model actually is definitely was beyond the scope of their first meeting. Only that much be said: A data model describes the structure of data. What are the properties of the individual objects? Are there any relationships between objects? And this not as a literary work but in a clear, precise figurative or formal language!
