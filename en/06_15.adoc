=== How close are operating decisions and means of transport? â€“ Independent topics

[#_6_15_1]
==== General remarks

Operating decisions always refer to a certain alpine transport. Consequently these two classes are linked by an association.

Nevertheless the objects of these two classes are quite different. It takes quite a lot to build an alpine transport and to alter any of its characteristics. Such modifications (and also those of the tickets) are always decided by the management. Operating decisions are a daily occurrence and are up to the works manager.

Condition reports are even more extreme: In the case of the more important alpine transports they are generated automatically every twenty minutes. For the input and processing of data sometimes different program packages are in use. This matter ought to be stated in some way in the concept.

[NOTE]
*Topics* put the model definition into order with regard to *responsibilities and occurrences in time*.

This offers the possibility that not all data have to be on hand on a certain computer system, or that certain topics are only read, but never altered.

[NOTE]
Several *baskets* may exist in connection with one topic; these contain data related to this topic.

The computer system of the Mount Ilis Alpine Transports for instance comprises one basket each for the alpine transports, the tickets and other different operational aspects. The National Tourist Office also keeps one basket each for alpine transports and tickets. The Mount Ilis Alpine Transports always transmit modifications within the baskets of alpine transport and tickets to the National Tourist Office. The Blue Mountain Alpine Transports and all other railway companies transmit their modifications or periodically a copy of their data baskets. Upon receipt the National Tourist Office integrates the data contained in these baskets in their own.

Thanks to the organization of these models in different topics data can be transmitted specifically. Only the baskets containing topics of relevance to the receiver need to be transmitted.

==== Independence of topics

If an alpine transport is pulled down, then consequently the data object is deleted. This modification will be made known to the Tourist Office. However if only the basket of alpine transport is transmitted, a contradiction will result within the data of the National Tourist Office. There will be tariff zones that still are connected to the alpine transport, even though it has been deleted. Obviously enough relationships that span topic limits are particularly tricky.

[NOTE]
Topics should not, or as little as possible, depend on one another Relationships that are topic spanning should be avoided whenever possible. If they occur they have to be marked especially within the model.

In graphic representations of models such relationships are relatively easy to spot, provided the representation clearly depicts topics and relationships. In the textual representation of INTERLIS 2 must be marked with the keyword EXTERNAL. Furthermore they are only admissible if the topics have been declared dependent (DEPENDS ON). Mutual dependencies (even if indirect) are inadmissible.

But how can we avoid relationships beyond the bounds of topics without consequently having to limit ourselves to one single topic?

==== The responsibility of sender and receiver

Of course the relationship between an operating decision and the alpine transport it refers to simply cannot be avoided. Nevertheless it still makes sense to keep alpine transports and operating decisions in different topics. And with this relationship there really should be no problem about things not matching. Both topics and their corresponding baskets are updated by the Mount Ilis Alpine Transports. But mainly with fast moving objects that are referred to via relationships in different topics conflicts cannot always be precluded.

INTERLIS 2 lays down the following regulation:

[NOTE]
Correctness of the relationships within one basket is the responsibility of the sender. The receiver has to deal with the fact that objects belonging to a topic-spanning relationship may not be known at a given moment. Then again the receiver may proceed on the assumption that even topic spanning relationships are correct if there are matching versions of the corresponding baskets.

The first rule whereby a basket internally has to be correct must be obeyed even if for some reason a basket is divided.
