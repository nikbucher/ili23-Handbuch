=== IV. System independent data transfer

The case of data as such is quite similar to that of the description of data structure. Consequently we do not only need standards for the description of data but also for their transfer. When transferring data from one system to another we kind of use Esperanto, within the individual systems the respective mother tongue is spoken.

Having applied such intensive care to the data structure, one no longer wants to be bothered with these details. So INTERLIS serves a double purpose: Along with the description of data structure the transfer of the corresponding data has been defined as well.

It is of utmost importance that this data description cannot only be read and understood by human beings. Because of its formal language definition computer programs can also read it. Based on data description and transfer rules it is evident how a subsequent data transfer will have to be structured.
